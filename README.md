- User is presented with a random series of button presses.
- Each time user input a series of button presses correctly, user sees the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
- User hears a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when user personally presses a button.
- If user press the wrong button, User is notified that he/she have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind him/hers of the pattern so user can try again.
- User can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
- If User wants to restart, user can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
-  User can play in strict mode where if user gets a button press wrong, it notifies the user that he/she have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
 - User can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. User is notified of the victory, then the game starts over.
